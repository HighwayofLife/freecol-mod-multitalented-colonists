Multi-Talented Experts FreeCol Mod
====================================

This is a [FreeCol](http://www.freecol.org/) Mod. FreeCol is a turn-based strategy game based on the old game Colonization, and similar to Civilization. The objective of the game is to create an independent nation. You start with only a few colonists defying the stormy seas in their search for new land.

# Multi-Talented Experts
This mod expands the skill of expert colonists experience. By default, each expert role gives the ability for that colonist to output a higher quantity of one specific good unit. For example, the Expert Farmer only outputs a higher quantity of Grain. This mod enables Experts to have additional albeit smaller number of outputs in related production. By default, most experts have a multiplier of x2 for their production output, the exceptions are the Farmer, Fisherman, Preacher, and Carpenter. This mod changes these experts to have a multiplier of x2 for their primary expert production.
